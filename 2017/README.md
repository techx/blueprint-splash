# Blueprint Splash Page 2017

## Dev Setup
Make sure you have SASS installed! We use this to make styling easlier (SASS has support for variables, mixins, nesting, etc). You can install it at http://sass-lang.com/install.

In one terminal window, run `make watch` or `sass --watch scss:css` to watch for changes in the `assets/scss` folder. In another terminal window, run `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000` to serve the current directory locally on port 8000. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the splash page.

## Deploying
Make sure the CSS is up to date (run `make all`), and make sure the changes to the CSS have been committed to the Git repo.

Run `git checkout gh-pages` to switch to the `gh-pages` branch from `master`. Run `git merge master` to merge changes in `master` into `gh-pages` and then push your changes. The splash page should then update automatically within a few minutes.

Run `git checkout master` to switch back to the `master` branch and continue development work.
