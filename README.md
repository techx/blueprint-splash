comrades, lets get this üçû

## Setup

```npm install```

## Run

```gulp dev```


## How things are organized and what to do

oh yah and btw if the above two things didn't work you prob need npm, node, and gulp. you can get gulp from [this page](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/)

things are organized as such:
- everything you see is in the index.html file, there are sections that correspond to about, tracks, faq, and schedule
- everything you run gulp, it follows instructions in gulpfile.js and compiles the scss files into css stuff in the css folder. so make sure you only edit the scss stuff
- the js folder is for the amazing animations that marketting has planned for us
- the assets folder contains all of marketting's hard work

the final product for each section can be found in ```assets/Splash_Full_Annotations.png``` refer to this as the gold standard :-)
